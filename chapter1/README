Here you can find the examples of the first chapter of the code and also the exercies.
almost all the code is commented as was thinking about it.. 
These are examples more to show the code instead of learning about it.

Note:I'm writing at the moment I'm writing the code so any TYPO or Grammar error.. 
I only can said, well sorry for my bad english!
